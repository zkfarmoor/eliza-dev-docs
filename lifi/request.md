# ðŸ“œRequest Routes/Quotes

Prior to executing any swap or bridging, you need to request the best route from our smart routing API.

The LI.FI SDK provides functionality to request routes and quotes, as well as to execute them. This guide will walk you through the process of making a request using `getRoutes` and `getQuote` functions.

## 

[](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes#how-to-request-routes)

How to request Routes

To get started, here is a simple example of how to request routes to bridge and swap 10 USDC on Arbitrum to the maximum amount of DAI on Optimism.

Copy

```
import { getRoutes } from '@lifi/sdk';

const routesRequest: RoutesRequest = {
  fromChainId: 42161, // Arbitrum
  toChainId: 10, // Optimism
  fromTokenAddress: '0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831', // USDC on Arbitrum
  toTokenAddress: '0xDA10009cBd5D07dd0CeCc66161FC93D7c9000da1', // DAI on Optimism
  fromAmount: '10000000', // 10 USDC
};

const result = await getRoutes(routesRequest);
const routes = result.routes;
```

When you request routes, you receive an array of route objects containing the essential information to determine which route to take for a swap or bridging transfer. At this stage, transaction data is not included and must be requested separately. Read more [Execute Routes/Quotes](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/execute-routes-quotes).

Additionally, if you would like to receive just one best option that our smart routing API can offer, it might be better to request a quote using `getQuote`. See [Request a Quote](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes#request-a-quote) section.

## 

[](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes#timing)

Timing

The `Timing` interface allows you to specify preferences for the timing of route execution. This can help optimize the performance of your requests based on timing strategies.

Parameters for the `Timing` interface:

- `**swapStepTimingStrategies**` **(TimingStrategy[], optional)** An array of timing strategies specifically for each swap step in the route. This allows you to define custom strategies for timing control during the execution of individual swap steps.
    
- `**routeTimingStrategies**` **(TimingStrategy[], optional)** An array of timing strategies that apply to the entire route. This enables you to set preferences for how routes are timed overall, potentially improving execution efficiency and reliability.
    

## 

[](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes#timing-strategy)

Timing Strategy

This can help optimize the timing of requests based on specific conditions.

Parameters:

- `**strategy**` **(string)** The strategy type, which must be set to `'minWaitTime'`. This indicates that the timing strategy being applied is based on a minimum wait time.
    
- `**minWaitTimeMs**` **(number)** The minimum wait time in milliseconds before any results are returned. This value ensures that the request waits for a specified duration to allow for more accurate results.
    
- `**startingExpectedResults**` **(number)** The initial number of expected results that should be returned after the minimum wait time has elapsed. This helps in managing user expectations regarding the outcomes of the request.
    
- `**reduceEveryMs**` **(number)** The interval in milliseconds at which the expected results are reduced as the wait time progresses. This parameter allows for dynamic adjustments to the expected results based on the elapsed time.
    

You can implement [custom timing strategies](https://docs.li.fi/li.fi-api/li.fi-api/requesting-a-quote/optimizing-quote-response-timing) to improve the user experience and optimize the performance of your application by controlling the timing of route execution.

## 

[](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes#request-a-quote)

Request a Quote

When you request a quote, our smart routing API provides the best available option. The quote includes all necessary information and transaction data required to initiate a swap or bridging transfer.

Here is a simple example of how to request a quote to bridge and swap 10 USDC on Arbitrum to the maximum amount of DAI on Optimism.

Copy

```
import { getQuote } from '@lifi/sdk';

const quoteRequest: QuoteRequest = {
  fromChain: 42161, // Arbitrum
  toChain: 10, // Optimism
  fromToken: '0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831', // USDC on Arbitrum
  toToken: '0xDA10009cBd5D07dd0CeCc66161FC93D7c9000da1', // DAI on Optimism
  fromAmount: '10000000', // 10 USDC
  // The address from which the tokens are being transferred.
  fromAddress: '0x552008c0f6870c2f77e5cC1d2eb9bdff03e30Ea0', 
};

const quote = await getQuote(quoteRequest);
```

Contract call Quote request parameters

The `getContractCallsQuote` function expects a `ContractCallsQuoteRequest` object, which includes all the information needed to request a quote for a destination contract call.

Contract call quote request can be treated as an extension to the quote request and in addition to the parameters mentioned below, all parameters listed in the [Other Quote parameters](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes#other-quote-parameters) section (such as `integrator`, `fee`, `slippage`, etc.) are also available when using `getContractCallsQuote`.

#### 

[](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes#fromchain-number-required-1)

`**fromChain**` (number, required)

The ID of the source chain (e.g., Ethereum mainnet is 1).

#### 

[](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes#fromtoken-string-required-1)

`**fromToken**` (string, required)

The contract address of the token on the source chain. Ensure this address corresponds to the specified `fromChain`.

#### 

[](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes#fromaddress-string-required-1)

`**fromAddress**` (string, required)

The address from which the tokens are being transferred.

#### 

[](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes#tochain-number-required-1)

`**toChain**` (number, required)

The ID of the destination chain (e.g., Optimism is 10).

#### 

[](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes#totoken-string-required-1)

`**toToken**` (string, required)

The token required to perform the contract interaction (can be something to stake, donate, or to be used as payment). Ensure this address corresponds to the specified `toChain`.

#### 

[](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes#toamount-string-required)

`toAmount` (string, required)

The amount of tokens required by the contract interaction. The LI.FI API will try and generate a quote that guarantees at least that amount on the destination chain.

#### 

[](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes#tofallbackaddress-string-optional)

`toFallbackAddress` (string, optional)

The address to send the bridged tokens to if the call fails. Defaults to the sending address if not specified.

#### 

[](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes#contractcalls-contractcall-required)

`contractCalls` (ContractCall[], required)

Array of contract call objects.

- `fromAmount` (string, required): The amount of tokens to be sent to the contract. This amount is independent of any previously bridged or deposited tokens.
    
- `fromTokenAddress` (string, required): The address of the token to be sent to the contract. For example, an ETH staking transaction would require ETH.
    
- `toContractAddress` (string, required): The address of the contract to interact with on the destination chain.
    
- `toContractCallData` (string, required): The call data to be sent to the contract for the interaction on the destination chain.
    
- `toContractGasLimit` (string, required): The estimated gas required for the contract call. Incorrect values may cause the interaction to fail.
    
- `toApprovalAddress` (string, optional): The address to approve the token transfer if it is different from the contract address.
    
- `toTokenAddress` (string, optional): The address of the token that will be output by the contract, if applicable (e.g., staking ETH produces stETH).
    

#### 

[](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes#contractoutputstoken-string-optional)

`contractOutputsToken` (string, optional)

The token address that will be output by the contract, if applicable. Omit if no token should be returned.

Difference between `Route` and `Quote`

Even though `Route` and `Quote` terms lie in the same field of providing you with the best option to make a swap or bridging transfer, there are some differences you need to be aware of.

A `Route` in LI.FI represents a detailed transfer plan that may include _multiple steps_. Each step corresponds to an individual transaction, such as swapping tokens or bridging funds between chains. These steps must be executed in a specific sequence, as each one depends on the output of the previous step. A `Route` provides a detailed pathway for complex transfers involving multiple actions.

In contrast, a `Quote` is a _single-step_ transaction. It contains all the necessary information to perform a transfer in one go, without requiring any additional steps. `Quotes` are used for simpler transactions where a single action, such as a token swap or a cross-chain transfer, is sufficient. Thus, while `Routes` can involve multiple steps to complete a transfer, a `Quote` always represents just one step.
